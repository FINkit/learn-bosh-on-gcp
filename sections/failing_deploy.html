<%= circled_title(3, "Debugging failing deploy") %>

<p>When deploy command fails there are could be a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalid network configuration in deployment manifest (e.g. IP address is in use or out of subnet range)</li>
<li>Infrastructure provider failed to create VM or disk (e.g. quota exceeded, instance type is not available)</li>
<li>Properties required by release were not provided in manifest</li>

<p>Let's add another job to our manifest and call it <b>router</b>. It will balance requests between the app servers in a round-robin fashion. Since the uploaded release already contains the router job, we don't need to update the release.</p>

<p>To do this, we'll create a new instance group and give it the <b>router</b> job. Add the following text to the bottom of <b>manifest.yml</b>:</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-printout-text">- name: router
  azs:
  - z1
  templates:
  - name: router
  instances: 1
  vm_type: g1-small
  stemcell: default
  networks:
  - name: default
    static_ips: [10.0.0.12]</h4>
</div>

<p>Re-deploy with the new job.</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh -d learn-bosh-on-gcp deploy manifest.yml</h4>
  <h4 class="terminal-printout-warning">...Failed: `router/0 (...)' is not running after update.
  </h4>
</div>

<p>Oh-oh, looks like the deployment failed. Let's get our service logs, untar them and check stderr log.</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh -d learn-bosh-on-gcp logs router/0</h4>
</div>

<p>We should find this error: "At least one server must be provided". The router fails to route because there are no servers specified.</p>

<p>Let's add a property to the router job to specify our servers pointing to their static IPs and ports.</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-printout-text">- name: router
  azs:
  - z1
  templates:
  - name: router
  instances: 1
  vm_type: g1-small
  stemcell: default
  networks:
  - name: default
    static_ips: [10.0.0.12]
  properties:
    servers: ["http://10.0.0.10:8888", "http://10.0.0.11:8888"]</h4>
</div>

<p>Re-deploy and see that it now succeeds.</p>

<p>Now running <b>curl -L http://10.0.0.12:8080</b> should give us responses from different servers.</p>

<%= circled_title(3, "Debugging failing deploy") %>

<p>When deploy command fails there are could be a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalid network configuration in deployment manifest (e.g. IP address is in use or out of subnet range)</li>
<li>Infrastructure provider failed to create VM or disk (e.g. quota exceeded, instance type is not available)</li>
<li>Properties required by release were not provided in manifest</li>

<p>Let's add another job to our manifest <b>router</b> (it will redirect all requests between servers). Note, that since uploaded release already contains this job, we don't need to update release.</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-printout-text">- name: router
  templates:
  - name: router
  instances: 1
  resource_pool: default
  networks:
  - name: default
    static_ips: [10.0.0.12]</h4>
</div>

<p>Re-deploy with new job.</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh -d learn-bosh-on-gcp deploy manifest.yml</h4>
  <h4 class="terminal-printout-warning">...Failed: `router/0 (...)' is not running after update.
  </h4>
</div>

<p>Oh-oh, looks like deploy failed. Let's get our service logs, untar them and check stderr log.</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh -d learn-bosh-on-gcp logs router/0</h4>
</div>

<p>We should find this error: "At least one server must be provided". Router fails to route because there is no servers specified.</p>

<p>Let's add a property to router job to specify our servers pointing to their static IPs and ports.</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-printout-text">- name: router
  templates:
  - name: router
  instances: 1
  resource_pool: default
  networks:
  - name: default
    static_ips: [10.0.0.12]
  properties:
    servers: "http://10.0.0.10:8888, http://10.0.0.11:8888"</h4>
</div>

<p>Re-deploy and see it succeeds.</p>

<p>Now running <b>curl -L http://10.0.0.10:8888</b> should give us responses from different servers.</p>

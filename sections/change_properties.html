<%= circled_title(3, "Change properties") %>

<p>Every release can specify a set of properties that need to be set in deployment manifest and provided to service. For example, that can be database credentials, address of another service, etc.</p>

<p>Our release allows to change property port on which server is listening. You can see the list of properties that can be modified in learn-bosh-release/jobs/app/spec. Let's open manifest.yml and under the section properties set the value of port to 8888 - not forgetting to remove the curly brackets after properties (representing the formerly empty set):</p>
<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">...
  jobs:
    - name: app
      release: learn-bosh-on-gcp
      properties:
        port: 8888
...</h4>
</div>

<p>Now we can just re-deploy our manifest changes. Note, we don't need to build new release version, configuration files will be regenerated with new properties:</p>
<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh -d learn-bosh-on-gcp deploy manifest.yml</h4>
</div>

<p>Let's see that our property was changed:</p>
<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ curl http://10.0.0.10:8888 --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:5000</h4>
  <h4 class="terminal-printout-text">Hello, [your name] from &lt;uuid-1&gt;</h4>
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ curl http://10.0.0.11:8888 --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:5000</h4>
  <h4 class="terminal-printout-text">Hello, [your name] from &lt;uuid-1&gt;</h4>
</div>

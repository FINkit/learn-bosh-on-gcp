<h1>Prepare</h1>

<p>We are going to create a BOSH Environment. First we will create the necessary infrastructure in GCP within a dedicated GCP Project, then create a BOSH Jumpbox using BOSH. We will then create a BOSH Director tunnelling connections through the BOSH Jumpbox executed from your host machine. Once the BOSH Director is running we will use the BOSH CLI to send commands through the BOSH Jumpbox to the BOSH Director.</p>

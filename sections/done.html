<h1>Done!</h1>

<p>In this tutorial we created a BOSH Bastion in Google Cloud Platform and used the BOSH CLI on that bastion to create a BOSH Director. We deployed a release, updated our deployment with source changes, scaled the number of services and changed their properties on that BOSH Director. We also recovered a failing service, failing VM and failing deploy.</p>

<p>The BOSH Director can work with any CPI (Cloud Provider Interface) that implements a certain API to manage IaaS resources. There are several supported CPIs for different IaaS providers: AWS, GCP, Openstack, vSphere, vCloud and VirtualBox (a.k.a. BOSH Lite). You can read more about CPIs here: <a href="http://bosh.io/docs/cpi-api-v1.html">http://bosh.io/docs/cpi-api-v1.html</a>.</p>

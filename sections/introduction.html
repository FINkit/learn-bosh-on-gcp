<h2>A Guide to Using</h2>
<h1>BOSH on GCP</h1>

<p>This tutorial aims to give a <i>relatively</i> simple introduction to using BOSH on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).</p>

<p>It is <b>heavily</b> based on the excellent <a href="http://mariash.github.io/learn-bosh/">A Guide to Using BOSH</a> tutorial, written by <a href="https://github.com/mariash">Maria Shaldibina</a>.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:
<ul>
  <li>A GCP account (at the time of writing a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/">Free Tier</a> is available). However, EU residents are not currently able to use the Free Tier as individuals. This is discussed in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/frequently-asked-questions">Google's Cloud Platform Free Tier FAQ</a> and on <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-way-to-use-Google-Cloud-Platform-as-individual-in-Europe">Quora</a>.</li>
  <li>A local installation of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/">Google Cloud SDK</a> on your environment PATH. Version 183.0.0 is known to work with the instructions in the guide.</li>
  <li>A local installation of <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html">BOSH CLI v2</a> on your environment PATH. Version 2.0.45 is known to work with the instructions in this guide.</li>
  <li>An environment on which to run BASH scripts.</li>
</ul>

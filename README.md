# A Guide to Using BOSH on GCP

This is the source for the Using BOSH on GCP guide - http://rigoford.github.io/learn-bosh-on-gcp/.

It is *heavily* based on the excellent [A Guide to Using BOSH](http://mariash.github.io/learn-bosh/) tutorial, written by [Maria Shaldibina](https://github.com/mariash).

All section files are in the `sections` folder.

The guide uses [fullPage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js) because it is fancy.

To add a new section:
* add the appropriate HTML file to `sections`.
* add the section information to [sections.json](sections.json). The first key is the group of sections - used in CSS for styling. The next key is the section anchor that will appear during scrolling. Its value is the section Title that appears in the side navigation.

The guide consists of a single static page (*index.html*), which can be generated by issuing:
```
./generate.rb
```

If you're going to be making lots of changes, issue the following command to regenerate the page when the relevant files change.
```
fswatch -o sections -o css/* -o templates/*| xargs -n1 ./generate.rb
```

Helpers available in sections:
* `circled_title(number, title)` - generates HTML with a circled number and a title.
